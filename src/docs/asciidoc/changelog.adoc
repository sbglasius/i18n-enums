#### v2.0.1
Code cleanup by Burt Beckwith. Thank you for your contribution.

#### v2.0.0
The plugin is now rewritten for Grails 3.x and is not backwards compatible.

* Still supports annotations, where configuration can be done on every annotation or in config
* Now also supports implementing the I18nEnumTrait on your own enumerations.
* Documentation mentions what sections that only works for Grails 3.x

#### v1.0.8
Cleanup. No functionality changes.

#### v1.0.7

* Files to be pre-compiled moved from groovy-ast to groovy, that way Intellij Idea can find them when parsing the project for completions.
* Test project (test/project/I18nEnumTest) now has more tests incl. GEB

#### v1.0.5, v1.0.6
Updating plugin descriptor, documentation and build dependencies

#### v1.0.4
Documentation now on GitHub pages instead of grails.org

#### v1.0.3
Plugin now runs under Grails 2.4.x
It is no longer a binary plugin. It should compile before all other classes.

#### v1.0.2
The plugin is now released as a binary plugin due to AST transformations not being applied to inlined plugins.

#### v1.0.1
Grails event hook to precompile AST transformations before the rest of the Grails compile phase. This is needed
so that enums annotated will be compiled correctly.

#### v1.0.0
The plugin was formerly known as *EnumMessageSourceResolvable*, but was renamed to I18nEnums for easier reading and writing. Functionality wise it has not changed from v1.0.0 of EnumMessageSourceResolvable.

Now support configuration in Config.groovy - see documentation below
